## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Four card feature section challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating a four card feature section for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. See the social media share links when they click the share icon.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - This was surprisingly easy to complete. I choose to go with the grid approach and it was very easy after structuring the grid areas. I opted to use the :where pseudo function to easy up the selection process. After accomplishing the desktop version, the mobile layout almost adjusted itself after using grid-template-colums: 1fr. I liked the final layout =)
